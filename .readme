## Thaumaturgia

Thaumaturgia is a voxel-based survival game written in C# with extensive modding capabilities. This project is currently in very early stages of development and any contribution is gladly appreciated. 

## Modding

Modding is intended to be handled via Harmony and BepInEx (after implementation) <3
Since fields aren't modifiable after compilation (@Shadow when), it's recommended to use ```Thaumaturgia.Modding.Field``` for fields.
